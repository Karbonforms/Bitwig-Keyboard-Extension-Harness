# Bitwig-Keyboard-Extension-Harness

Pre-requisites: Python

1. Install required Python modules...

pip install keyboard

pip install mido

pip install python-rtmidi

2. Put the files in your Bitwig Controller Scripts folder. (The .py Python file can be anywhere but one may as well keep them together)

3. Execute the kb_device.py Python file. e.g. "python kb_device.py" from a console (I've just been running it in debug mode using vscode)
